***1. Write a Quarto document that defines variables $a = 1, b = 3, c = 2$ and print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$.***

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Define the variables 
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2

# Write the discriminant
m <- b^2-4*a*c 

# Solve the equation 
if(m > 0){ # The equation has two solutions 
  x1 <- (-b + sqrt(m))/2*a
  x2 <- (-b - sqrt(m))/2*a
  
  print(paste("The equation has two solutions: x1 =", x1, " x2 =", x2))
} else if (m == 0){ # The equation has one solution
  x <- (-b + sqrt(m))/2*a
  
  print(paste("The equation has one solution: x =", x))
} else{ # The equation has no solution
  print("The equation has no solution")
}

```

***2. Include a graph of $f(x)$ to confirm the result.***

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Draw the plot to find the solution for x 
x <- seq(-3, 0, , length = 300)
plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
```

From the graph, it shows that the equation $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$ when $a = 1, b = 3, c = 2$ has two solutions, x1 = -1, x2 = -2.
